The idea behind the department\u2019s innovative Heritage Language Program is that heritage language students have a set of skills, competencies, and needs that are distinct from those of both native speakers learning to read and write the language for the first time, and also nonnative learners who may study it as a foreign language during adulthood. These students therefore require a different type of language instruction, one that builds on and enhances the linguistic skills they already possess and amplifies their cultural competence and literacy. The Heritage Language Program allows students to work toward developing higher levels of proficiency in order to pursue personal and professional goals."

An unprecedented architecture of shaped space used new materials and revolutionary engineering techniques in boldly functional ways for purposes of psychological control and symbolic assertion. Sculpture in the round and in relief was pictorialized to gain spatial effects and immediacy of presence, and an extraordinary art of portraiture investigated the psychology while asserting the status claims of the individual. Extreme shifts of style, from the classicism of the age of Augustus to the expressionism of the third century AD, are characteristic of this period.
